## SQL

* **SQL** stands for Structured Query Language, which is a language was design to control data in the data base.
* **Relational data base** think of it as two dimensional tables that you can control its content by selecting the column that a certain data reside in, and you can manipulate the data with many different commands.

Some basic **SQL** commands:

* `SELECT "column name"`: you can select multiple columns by separate them with a comma. You can select all columns by using (*).
* `FROM "table name"`.
* Logical operators: there are many logical operators which make your selection more specific, you can even search for a certain pattern, or something similar to what you are searching for.
* Also you can join multiple tables and apply some mathematical operations on the data.
