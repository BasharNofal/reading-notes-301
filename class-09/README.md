## Refactoring

### Functional Programming

Basically, it means avoiding shared data between functions and making my code easily modular, which results in having readable, and free of bugs code, but that doesn't mean that it will be shorter.

### Refactoring Code

Applying some small non-behavioral changes to the code that leave it in a better state, more readable, and most of the time shorter, but the output should remain the same as before.

**Refactoring** and **Functional programming** has a lot in common, where both terms results in having smaller, more readable, and much much efficient code than before, and usually these changes are applied after finishing the code and when we get the desirable output.
