## DATABASE NORMALIZATION

* **Database Normalization** is a way to reduce or minimize data redundancy or duplicated data.
* This can be done by dividing a table into multiple smaller table or by separating the data that one table contain.
* Data redundancy can lead not to only taking a lot more storage than needed, it also can lead to multiple problems when updating, deleting, and inserting new data to the table.
* So Basically what **database normalization** means is having one table the contain information about one subject, and having a connection between multiple small tables is better than having one huge table because their will be duplicates in that table.
