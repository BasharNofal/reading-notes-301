## SMACSS and Responsive Web Design

**SMACCS** (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS)

 Which basically means dividing your CSS code into multiple categories which makes easier to be edited later.

**SMACCS** can be done by dividing your code into the following categories (CSS files):

1- *Base.css*: which contains the lines that are the most general which you're gonna apply to the multiple and parent html elements.

2- *Layout.css*: from its name, in this you write the rules for your page layout which is a bit more specified than those in the *base.css*.

3-*Module.css*: here we apply the rules regarding some elements that need more adjustments to be done to their dimensions for example, which again here you're being more specific than you're in *layout.css*.

4- *Theme.css*: last file here your applying the rules regarding coloring and font styling.


**Responsive Web Design**

 Which basically means designing websites to suit every screen size, whether the website was opened with a mobile phone or desktop ... etc.

 That can be done by the following:

 1- Using percentages instead of absolute values when specifying dimensions.

 2- Using *media query*: media query writing some css rules which will be applied when a conditions (screen dimensions) is applied, as the following:
