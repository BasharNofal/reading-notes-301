## REST 

**REST** stands for Representational State Transfer, it's a standard architectural style API used by what's called **RESTful** services, what **REST** does is communicating or send *http* requests from websites to servers to do one of four operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD).

Http requests consists of:

* Body/data.
* Method/operation.
* Endpoint.
