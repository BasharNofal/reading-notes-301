## Node.js

**Node.js**  is an open source server environment which runs on various platforms and uses JavaScript.

Using **node.js** has many advantages, using one programming language to build your project, also **node.js** is memory efficient because it runs single threaded,
non-blocking programming, which means that when it sends a request to device it doesn't wait for the device to respond back, it continues with the other requests
and as soon as the device sends a response it resumes the operation, which is the opposite to PHP and ASP for example.
